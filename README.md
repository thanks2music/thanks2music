I love family and pets (dogs, cats, birds—basically all animals), music, anime, manga, movies, TV dramas, games, basketball, and programming.

## 🏀 My hobbies

I consider myself an anime and manga nerd, but since I also enjoy sports, ChatGPT once called me a "new type of nerd"—and I liked that description.

If I listed everything I love, the list would never end, so here are just a few of my favorites:

### 🎹 Music I Often Listen To

I generally prefer listening to international music over Japanese music.
The reason is that I often listen to music while working or focusing on tasks, and lyrics in my native language, Japanese, can sometimes interfere with my thinking.
That’s why I tend to choose music without lyrics or in foreign languages—like piano, jazz, or swing.

Of course, I’m still familiar with many popular Japanese artists, bands, and anime songs!
Here are some of the genres I often listen to:

- Electronic
- Rock
- Piano
- Jazz
- Swing
- Hip-hop
- Indie
- Punk
- Hardcore
- Drum and Bass
- Dubstep

### 📖 Manga
