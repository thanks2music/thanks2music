# Hi, I'm Yoshiyuki Ito 🙋‍♂️

## 👨‍💻 🦮 WE ARE ALL ONE 🐈 🎩

I'm a web developer working remotely from Fukuoka, Japan, living with my beloved wife, a cat named Mika, and a toy poodle named Yoru.

I love family and pets (dogs, cats, birds—basically all animals), music, anime, manga, movies, TV dramas, games, basketball, and programming.

and My grandfather is the noble Golden Retriever named Ben. When I was a child, I was taught by my beloved Ben that “the world is WE ARE ALL ONE, so be kind to others.”

## 🏀 My hobbies

I consider myself an anime and manga nerd, but since I also enjoy sports, ChatGPT once called me a "new type of nerd"—and I liked that description.

If I listed everything I love, the list would never end, so here are just a few of my favorites:

### 🎹 Music I Often Listen To

I generally prefer listening to international music over Japanese music.
The reason is that I often listen to music while working or focusing on tasks, and lyrics in my native language, Japanese, can sometimes interfere with my thinking.
That’s why I tend to choose music without lyrics or in foreign languages—like piano, jazz, or swing.

Of course, I’m still familiar with many popular Japanese artists, bands, and anime songs!
Here are some of the genres I often listen to:

- Electronic
- Rock
- Piano
- Jazz
- Swing
- Hip-hop
- Indie
- Punk
- Hardcore
- Drum and Bass
- Dubstep
